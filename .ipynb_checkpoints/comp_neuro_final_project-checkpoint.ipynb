    "## What is a word embedding?\n",
    "\n",
    "An embedding is a way to represent a vector in a smaller space, while losing minimal information. Thus, it effectively compresses a high-dimension vector into a lower-dimension vector. This enables much more efficient computation of large inputs. One example of a large input which would benefit from embedding is words. As described later in this notebook, a word can be numerically represented by a large, sparse vector (and thus, multiple words can be represented by a large, sparse matrix). Through embedding, we can shrink the size of our word's numerical representation, creating a word embedding!\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we feed our large, sparse representation of words into a 2-layer, feed-forward, dense, linear neural network, and we train our model with unsupervised learning. The first layer \"encodes\" a large, sparse word vector, creating a word embedding. The second layer then \"decodes\" the embedding, with the goal of returning the original word vector. The model then assesses how close its decoded vector is to the original vector, and undergoes backpropagation to update its weights accordingly. Thus, the model gradually minimizes its error, which implies that the model's encoding retains the meaining of the original input vector (at the very least, the model can make sense of its own word embedding).\n",

    "With all that aside, let's look at how we can construct our large, sparse matrix of word vectors."

    "    - In essence, Adam still does the same thing. It computes the gradient, which points to a higher point on the loss function. Then, it moves the weights by a small portion of the gradient, but in the opposite direction. With Adam, other complex features are added, such as momentum, which means that the weights will retain some movement from previous iterations of gradient descent.\n",
